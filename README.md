## üèÅ Ready to Start?

Let‚Äôs get building. Power on your lab and begin with **Task 1 ‚Äì Setup & Cable Management** üöÄ  
Stay consistent, stay curious. Rivan Home Labs is here to turn theory into real-world skills.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Task 1 ‚Äì Setup & Cable Management

Before configuring your devices, ensure all hardware is connected correctly. Refer to the Cabling Instructions PDF for step-by-step guidance on connecting IP Phones, Cameras, and Wireless APs to the appropriate ports. Once everything is set up, power on the devices and proceed with the configuration.

## ‚ö° Task 2: Check Power Inline Status

Use the `show power inline` command to check the power status of each port. This is important for verifying that devices like IP phones and cameras are receiving Power over Ethernet (PoE).


### Example Output:

```bash
CallCenter-28#show power inline
PowerSupply   SlotNum.   Maximum   Allocated       Status
-----------   --------   -------   ---------       ------
INT-PS           0        88.000    28.800          PS GOOD

Interface   Config   Device   Powered    PowerAllocated
---------   ------   ------   -------    --------------
Fa0/1/0     auto     Unknown  Off        0.000 Watts  
Fa0/1/1     auto     IEEE-2   On         7.000 Watts  
Fa0/1/2     auto     Unknown  Off        0.000 Watts  
Fa0/1/3     auto     IEEE-2   On         6.400 Watts  
Fa0/1/4     auto     Unknown  Off        0.000 Watts  
Fa0/1/5     auto     IEEE-4   On         15.400 Watts  
Fa0/1/6     auto     Unknown  Off        0.000 Watts  
Fa0/1/7     auto     Unknown  Off        0.000 Watts
```
## üåê Task 3: VLAN Checking and Configuration

Set up VLANs to segment the network. Use the 'show vlan-switch' commands to verify VLANs. Create at least 4 VLANs for different network sections.

```bash
config t
vlan 1
name default
vlan 10
name RIVANWIFI
vlan 50
name RIVANVIDEO
vlan 100
name RIVANVOIP
end
show vlan-switch
```
## üîÑ Task 3: LAN/Ethernet Ports to VLAN Assignment
Assign Ethernet ports to specific VLANs for proper network organization. This includes both data and voice VLANs.

```bash
config t
interface FastEthernet0/1/1 
 switchport mode access
 switchport voice vlan 100
interface FastEthernet0/1/3 
 switchport mode access
 switchport access vlan 50
interface FastEthernet0/1/5 
 switchport mode access
 switchport access vlan 10
interface FastEthernet0/1/7 
 switchport mode access
 switchport access vlan 1
end
show vlan-switch
```
